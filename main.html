		<h2>Summary</h2>
		<p>The Dark Knight follows Batman's alliance with District Attorney Harvey Dent and Lieutenant Jim Gordon to dismantle organized crime, but their efforts are challenged by the Joker, a chaotic mastermind who plunges Gotham into anarchy by attacking the city's corrupt leaders and framing Dent. The Joker orchestrates the deaths of key figures and engineers a tragic accident that disfigures Dent, transforming him into the villain Two-Face and pushing him to enact his own brand of chaotic justice. In the end, Batman makes the difficult choice to allow Dent to be hailed as Gotham's hero and to take the blame for Two-Face's crimes, thus preserving Dent's image as the "White Knight" and remaining a symbol of fear for criminals.</p>
